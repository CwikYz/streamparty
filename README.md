# Sync video playback between browsers

Supported:
- Nothing

Soon to be supported:
- Youtube
- Vimeo
- Daily Motion

Finished:
- Sync play/pause/playback rate change/seek
- Sync new user on join

Todo:
- Search YT videos
- Add videos to queue

Issues:
- Spamming Play/Pause causes inconsistent `receiving` values
- Always a couple seconds lag when joining a video that is currently playing
- Does not handle waiting for others to buffer
